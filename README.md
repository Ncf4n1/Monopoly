How to Use the Monopoly Game

	Our version 1.1 Monopoly Game was created using Java with Java swing for the implementation of the user interface. This version of the game does not implement the Chance or Community Chest cards, the two Jail spaces, Free Parking, or auctions yet, but it does implement standard amount deductions for the two tax spaces ($100 for Luxury Tax, $200 for Income Tax). We have created the logic for most of these board spaces, thus allowing us to easily add the next piece of code to complete the implementation, but for now, if a player lands on a card space or a jail space, the game will do nothing, This is also true for Free Parking, but that is the expected behavior. Also, if a player refuses to purchase a property, they simply select End Turn and the game moves on to the next player’s turn.

	The game begins with a screen displaying two buttons, one saying “New Game” and one saying “Exit Game”. When the user selects “New Game”, a new screen appears with two options, a “Select number of players” which allows the user to choose up to 4 players and a “Select time limit” which allows the user to select a time limit for the game from 5 minutes to 60 minutes by 5 minute increments. The user then selects the start button, which will display an input box, prompting each user to enter a name and select a token. The GUI then displays the board with all players on the Go space. If any player passes the Go space too, they receive $200. Several buttons shall be displayed to the current player during his or her turn, including Take Turn, End Turn, Buy Property, Buy Houses, Buy Hotels,  and Sell Houses, Sell Hotels, and Mortgage. The game will also constantly display the name of each player, the current amount of money for each player, and the properties owned for each player. Gameplay starts with Player 1 selecting Take Turn and then their token moving that many spaces ahead. If the player lands on a property, railroad, or utility, the player will be able to click Buy Property, which associates the property with the player and deducts that money from their total. If the player lands on a tax space, the corresponding tax dollars will be deducted from their total. If the player lands on a property already owned, they will pay the corresponding rent to the correct player, including calculations for paying utility rent. Play then passes to the next Player. If a player owns a monopoly and wishes to put houses or hotels on those properties, the buttons will be enabled to do so. This also follows for selling houses and hotels. Whenever a player owns a property that is not mortgaged, they will be able to mortgage it at any time.
